## ⚠️Do not try to replicate what I did⚠️

7:00am: I arrived to school and started sodering my bucks

7:30am: I stopped sodering and went for flag raising

7:40am: I rushed back to lab to continue sodering my bucks

8:00am: Left for class

I skipped class to soder

yay finally the 3V3 and 5V bucks are sodered

i tested fuck doesnt work doesnt output

my senior came and found out that the root of the problem was a reversed diode polarity

3v3 buck and 5v works

after lessons i came back and sodered my l2 stm32 and the connectors for the teensy and openmv

wanted to program stm32 but could not find for the programmer probably lsot and decicded to find it tomorrow

i went home

reached home i tried searching how to program serial communiction between openmv and teensy

found a old blog on openmv forum by my sneior
